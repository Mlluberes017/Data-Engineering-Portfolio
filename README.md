# Data Engineering Portfolio – Scala & PySpark (EOI)

This repository contains my **Data Engineering Portfolio**, developed as part of the **Master’s Degree in Data Engineering at EOI**, using **Scala** and **PySpark**.

The purpose of this portfolio is to document my progressive learning journey, from foundational concepts to practical exercises and more structured examples.

---

## Academic Context

**Master’s Degree:** Data Engineering  
**Module:** Functional Programming, Scala & PySpark  
**Institution:** EOI – Escuela de Organización Industrial

This repository is based on both theoretical and practical concepts covered during the module, including:

- Functional Programming (FP)
- Pure functions & immutability
- Usage of `val`, `var`, and `def`
- Anonymous functions (lambdas)
- Higher-Order Functions (HOF)
- Currying & partially applied functions
- Collections (List, Seq, Tuple)

### Functional error handling:
- `Option`
- `Try`
- `Either`

Additional Scala concepts:
- Traits & mixins
- Generics
- Functional validations
- Scala as a hybrid language (FP + OOP)
- Introduction to PySpark (in later weeks)

---

## Repository Contents

### **Week 1 – Scala Fundamentals & Functional Programming**

This first stage focuses on the core Scala concepts, building the foundation for later Spark and PySpark work.

### Topics Covered

✔ Basic Scala syntax  
✔ Functions (`def`)  
✔ Anonymous functions (lambdas)  
✔ Higher-Order Functions  
✔ Collections (`List`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`)  
✔ Functional error handling  
✔ Traits  
✔ Generics  
✔ Functional validations

---

### Exercises Implemented

- **Semana1_Portfolio.scala** → Introductory Scala program
- **FuncionesBasicas.scala** → Named functions & lambdas
- **FuncionesOrdenSuperior.scala** → Higher-Order Functions
- **OptionBasico.scala** → Safe value handling
- **TryBasico.scala** → Exception handling
- **EitherValidacion.scala** → Functional error modeling
- **ColeccionesBasicas.scala** → `map` / `filter` / `reduce`
- **ValidacionesCorreo.scala** → Functional validations
- **GenericsBasico.scala** → Type parameters
- **NotasConTraitsApp.scala** → Traits + Collections + FP

## Mini Project – IoT Data Validator

A structured example simulating:

✔ Sensor data generation  
✔ Domain modeling  
✔ Functional validations  
✔ Valid vs invalid data partitioning  
✔ Error reporting  
✔ Basic execution time measurement

### Files:
- `IotDomain.scala`
- `IotDataValidations.scala`
- `IotDataValidatorApp.scala`

---

### **Week 2 – Scala & PySpark (In Progress)**

This stage begins to deepen into:

✔ Intermediate Scala  
✔ Conceptual integration with Spark  
✔ Introduction to PySpark  
✔ Transformations & actions  
✔ Functional modeling applied to data

*(Content under continuous development)*

---

## Technologies Used

- Scala
- PySpark *(later weeks)*
- sbt
- Java JDK 17 (Eclipse Temurin)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub
- Apache Spark

---

## Notebooks (Jupyter / Almond)

Some weeks may include notebooks using:

**Jupyter + Scala (Almond)**

Used for:

✔ Theoretical explanations  
✔ Interactive exercises  
✔ Learning documentation

They will be added progressively.
